# AdvancedGit

Challenges:
Part 1: Refining Git History (10 Challenges)

Missing File Fix:

Run git status and git log to assess the current state of your repository.
From the status you will see that you forgot to add test4.md in the last commit.
Challenge: Recover from this error by staging/adding test4.md and amending the commit message with an appropriate description.

Editing Commit History:

It's crucial to maintain accurate commit messages. Modify the message from "Create another file" to "Create second file".
Challenge: Utilize interactive rebasing (git rebase -i HEAD~2) to edit the commit message and ensure clarity. learn more about git rebase here

Keeping History Tidy - Squashing Commits:

Squashing combines multiple commits into a single one. Let's merge "Create second file" into "Create initial file" for a cleaner history.
Challenge: Use interactive rebasing with the squash command to achieve this. learn more about squash here

Splitting a Commit:

Imagine "Create third and fourth files" describes too much at once. Separate them for better tracking with two different commit messages: "Create Third File" and "Create fourth file".
Challenge: Leverage git reset to separate the files into individual commits with distinct messages. learn more about splitting commits here

Advanced Squashing:

Let's explore more complex squashing. Can you combine the last two commits ("Create third file" and "Create fourth file") into a single commit named "Create third and fourth files"?
Challenge: Utilize interactive rebasing with the squash command to achieve this advanced squash. Check step 4

Dropping a Commit:

We all make mistakes. Imagine needing to completely remove an unwanted commit from your history.

Create a new file named unwanted.txt add some changes and commit it with a message like "Unwanted commit".

Challenge: Use git rebase -i to identify and remove the "Unwanted commit" commit, cleaning up your history. learn more about dropping commits here

Reordering Commits:

Delve deeper into git rebase -i. Can you rearrange commits within your history using this command? learn more about ordering commits here
Cherry-Picking Commits:

Create a branch, call it ft/branch, and add a new file named test5.md with some content. Commit these changes with a message like "Implemented test 5".
Imagine you only desire a specific commit from ft/branch. Research and use git cherry-pick to selectively bring that commit into your current branch which is main.

Visualizing Commit History (Bonus):

Tools like git log --graph or a graphical Git client can help visualize your commit history. Explore these tools for a clearer understanding of your workflow.
Understanding Reflogs (Bonus):

Reflogs track Git operation history. Research about git reflog to learn how you can navigate back to previous states in your repository if needed.
Part 2: Branching Basics (10 Challenges)

Feature Branch Creation:

Imagine working on a new feature named ft/new-feature. Let's establish a dedicated branch for it.
Challenge: Create a new branch named ft/new-feature and switch to that branch.

Working on the Feature Branch:

Create a new file named feature.txt in this branch and add some content to it.
Commit these changes with a descriptive message like "Implemented core functionality for new feature".
Switching Back and Making More Changes:

It's common to switch between branches during development.
Challenge: Switch back to the main branch (previously master) and create a new file named readme.txt with some introductory content. Commit these changes with a message like "Updated project readme".

Local vs. Remote Branches:

So far, we've been working with local branches that exist on your machine. Research the concept of remote branches, which are copies of your local branches stored on a Git hosting platform like GitHub. Learn how to push your local branches to remote repositories and pull changes from them to keep your local and remote repositories in sync.
Branch Deletion:

After merging or completing work on a feature branch, it's good practice to remove it.
Challenge: Delete the ft/new-feature branch once you're confident the changes are integrated into main.

Creating a Branch from a Commit:

You can also create a branch from a specific commit in your history.
Challenge: Use git checkout -b ft/new-branch-from-commit commit-hash (adjust the commit hash as needed) to create a new branch named ft/new-branch-from-commit starting from the commit two positions back in your history. learn more here

Branch Merging:

Now that you've completed work on your feature branch, it's time to integrate it into main.
Challenge: Merge the ft/new-branch-from-commit branch into the main branch. Address any merge conflicts that might arise.

Branch Rebasing:

Rebasing is another method to integrate changes from a feature branch. It rewrites your branch history by incorporating its commits on top of the latest commit in the target branch (main in our case).
Challenge: Try rebasing the ft/new-branch-from-commit branch onto the main branch. Remember, rebasing rewrites history, so use it with caution, especially in shared repositories. learn more about rebasing here

Renaming Branches:

Branch names can sometimes evolve. Let's rename ft/new-branch-from-commit to a more descriptive name.
Challenge: Use git branch -m ft/new-branch-from-commit ft/improved-branch-name to rename your branch.

Checking Out Detached HEAD:

In specific situations, you might need to detach HEAD from your current branch. Research git checkout <commit-hash> (replace with the desired commit hash) to understand this concept.
Part 3: Advanced Workflows (10+ Challenges)

Stashing Changes:

Imagine you're working on some changes in the main branch but need to attend to something urgent. You don't want to lose your uncommitted work.
Challenge: Stash your current changes in the main branch using git stash.

Retrieving Stashed Changes:

Later, when you're ready to resume working on those stashed changes, you can retrieve them.
Challenge: Apply the most recent stash back onto the main branch using git stash pop.

Branch Merging Conflicts (Continued):

Merge conflicts can arise when the same lines of code are modified in both branches being merged.
Challenge: Simulate a merge conflict scenario (you can create conflicting changes in a file on both main and a new feature branch). Then, try merging again and resolve the conflicts manually using your text editor.

Resolving Merge Conflicts with a Merge Tool:

Explore using a merge tool like git mergetool to help you visualize and resolve merge conflicts more efficiently.
Understanding Detached HEAD State:

Detached HEAD refers to a state where your working directory is not associated with any specific branch. Research the implications and how to recover from this state using commands like git checkout <branch-name>.
Ignoring Files/Directories:

You might have files or directories you don't want to track in Git. Create a .gitignore file to specify these exclusions.
Challenge: Add a pattern like /tmp to your .gitignore file to exclude all temporary files and directories from version control. more about ignoring files here

Working with Tags:

Tags act like bookmarks in your Git history. Create a tag to mark a specific point in your development.
Challenge: Use git tag v1.0 to create a tag named v1.0 on the current commit in your main branch. git tags

Listing and Deleting Tags:

Challenge: Use git tag to list all existing tags. Then, use git tag -d <tag-name> to delete a specific tag (replace <tag-name> with the actual tag you want to remove).

Pushing Local Work to Remote Repositories:

Once you're happy with your local changes and branches, it's time to share them with others.
Challenge: Assuming you've set up a remote repository on a Git hosting platform (like GitHub), push the changes with the actual branch you want to push to push your local branch to the remote repository.

Pulling Changes from Remote Repositories:

Collaboration often involves pulling changes from the remote repository made by others.
